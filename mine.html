        <h1><i><b><u>TO MY DEAREST PERSON........</b></i></h1></u>
        <p>You are always been my love...what ever may be the situations
             around us and between us...i always used to love you...i dont know why? and i don't
              know how!.. u are such a huge magic which happened in my life...u have changed me a 
              lot...i know u will not agree with this...but its true..u changed my thinking..but i feel
               very supressed at some situations at you..which are almost used to kill me inside..but thats not
                being a big issue for me..your love is the only medicine for all my worst situations...but the badluck 
                is u were unable showoff sometimes..and i am unable to understand u...sometimes i really feel i
                 am very unfit and very undeserved person for you..i dont think that we can survive for long time 
                 happily...but that thought is always painful...because i cant live without you...my every thought
                  and my day is filled with u and your memories...but some situations made me feel very worst....
                  moreven i think.. i am not such a understable person and not even a merchured enough person to 
                  hold a relationship...infact a healthy relationship...i dont know how to express my exact feelings..
                  .but one thing....I always love to be myself...and i will more and more happy if u love me as
                   what i am....that means ...what is me and my thoughts and all...and i love you as what you are!..
                   u are free to express your feelings at me...no need to hide...if i never reacted for something
                    what u expressed at me...that doesnt mean i am not loving u...or i am not caring about your
                     feelings...i just only try to stop that thinking...not to stop your love at me...i always want
                      you...and i always need your love...for my life time...I LOVE YOU from the bottom of my heart......
                      moreven i miss u...missing u so so so much......i need you everytime...i need u to support me...
                      i need u to understand me...i need u to be myside all the tine...i need u ti love me and 
                      i want to love you...for each and every second of my life.....</p>
